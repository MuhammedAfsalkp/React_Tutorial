it is very useful
since the all datas are stored in single store,and
handle different reducers set functions for each logic
here 1-ui-slice
2-cart

then we integrate them to configure to single store.

but in reduxer function we could only do the synchrounous job
side effects,async code(sending request) code cannot be included in the normal reducer functions

for that we can either use that logic in component as useEffect then dispatch here

for better redux utilization we can create creator function manually like auto redux code

here it return a function it can access the dispatch
so after the task or throgh the task we can dispatch() to take necessary ui actions
,or dataChane in the store by calling the reducer function



*****   NOTE   ******
once we change the data stored in the redux store(thruogh the reducer function of any slice which is configured for the store)
(in case of creator function here also we are using the dispatch available to call the any reduce function configured throgh slices)
all the components which are using the data of the store (throgh the useSelector from react-redux)
will be rerendrered for the updation to get applied
(inside component useDispatch return dispatch ,which method is used for the updation to call the reducer function 
which can either include data as payload,on the called function it contain old state,action contain the payload as action.payload,
--if we have multiple payload use object wherever it need)
